The impact of indicator selection on assessment of global greening data

Figure 2. Maps of trends in six vegetation indicators (a-f), and the corresponding greening, browning and net greening (g-i):
figure2 is raster layer,those name corresponding to the article:
a:NDVI
b:MOD-GPP
c:PML-GPP
d:EVI2
e:NIRv
f:LAI

those raster value means：
1->greening
2->browning
0->notrend or no vegtation.

greening(g) and browning(h) were in table.zip package
figure g->the second table
figure h->the third table
note:figure i was the resulte of g subtract h

Figure S1:
figure S1-c:trends in temperature
figure S1-d:trends in temperature
the raster value is change magnitude

figureS1-g:unanimous results
raster value means：
1->greening
2->browning
0->notrend or no vegtation


figureS4:Distribution map of main styles of inconsistency not included in Figure 3 in the manuscript
the raster number means：
100001-PML-GPP and NDVI↑;
110000-PML-GPP and MOD-GPP↑;
110001-MOD-GPP,PML-GPP and NDVI ↑;
10001-MOD-GPP and NDVI ↑;
111-NDVI,NIRv and EVI2↑;
100111-PML-GPP,NDVI,NIRv and EVI2↑;
110111-PML-GPP , MOD-GPP,NDVI,NIRv and EVI2↑;
2000-LAI ↓;
220-EVI2 and NIRv ↓;
2-NDVI↓;
1000-LAI↑;
110-EVI2 and NIRv↑;
100000-PML-GPP↑

Figure4:(a) Concordance ratios between different indicators at the global scale; (b) and under changes in climate;
figure5:Inter-annual variations of six vegetation indicators and climatic variables globally (a) and across different latitudes (c-f)
data was in table.zip package
