figure2 a b c d e f:the raster number means：1->greening,2->browning,0->notrend or no vegtation.

figure2 g h i were in table.zip package:figure g->the second table,figure h->the third table,figure i was the resulte of g subtract h

figure S1-c and figure S1-d:precipitation and temperature magnitude,the value is change magnitude

figureS1-f:raster number means：1->greening,2->browning,0->notrend or no vegtation
